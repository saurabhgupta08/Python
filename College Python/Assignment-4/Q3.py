# Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the
# area.

# Import the 'pi' constant from the 'math' module to calculate the area of a circle
import math

# Prompt the user to input the radius of the circle
r = float(input("Input the radius of the circle : "))

# Calculate the area of the circle using the formula: area = Ï€ * r^2
area = math.pi * r ** 2

# Display the result, including the radius and calculated area
print("The area of the circle with radius " + str(r) + " is: " + str(area))
